## DP2Unlearning: An efficient and guaranteed unlearning framework for LLMs
**Publication Date:** Thu, 24 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400

**Summary:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also...

## Functionalized Nanofinger Enhances Pretrained Language Model Performance for Ultrafast Early Warning of Heart Attacks
**Publication Date:** Sun, 20 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400

**Summary:** Heart attacks are the leading cause of death worldwide, which means an accurate early warning system is needed. Traditional methods, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood test, usually require expert interpretation and take more than 15 min to obtain diagnostic results, which often results in delayed treatment. Our previous work [Liu, Z. Small 2023, 19(2), e2204719] developed a functionalized nanofinger platform utilizing Raman spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) to detect heart...

## Evaluation of a retrieval-augmented generation system using a Japanese Institutional Nuclear Medicine Manual and large language model-automated scoring
**Publication Date:** Sat, 19 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400

**Summary:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable domain-specific question answering using external knowledge. However, addressing information that is not included in training data remains a challenge, particularly in nuclear medicine, where examination protocols are frequently updated and vary across institutions. In this study, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using 40 internal manuals from a single Japanese hospital, each corresponding to a different examination...

## Cognitive plausibility of count-based versus prediction-based word embeddings: A large-scale N400 study
**Publication Date:** Sat, 19 Jul 2025 06:00:00 -0400

**Summary:** The N400 is a central electrophysiological event-related-potential (ERP) marker thought to reflect meaning comprehension in the human brain. Typically, the N400 is larger when a word does not fit into a specific context (e.g., I drink coffee with cream and dog). Thus, one core factor determining the N400 amplitude is thought to be the predictability of a word within its context. Here, both long-term memory associations and short-term discourse context influence the N400 amplitude. In the present...
